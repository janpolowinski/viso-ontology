viso-ontology
=============

The current VISO Visualization Ontology. Statements from the legacy VISO ontology are moved here as needed by the VISO users.

At the moment the modules "graphic" and "data" have the most actively migrated, since they are used in the [RVL project](https://github.com/janpolowinski/rvl).

The usage for code generation in RVL is also the reason for some extra files in the folder "/modules/graphic-for-rvl-codegen".
