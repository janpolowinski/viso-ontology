viso-ontology
=============

The current VISO Visualization Ontology. Statements from the legacy VISO ontology are moved here as needed by the VISO users.

For details look into our [WIKI pages](https://github.com/viso-ontology/viso-ontology/wiki).

At the moment the modules "graphic" and "data" have the most actively migrated, since they are used in the [RVL project](https://github.com/semvis/rvl).

The usage for code generation in RVL is also the reason for some extra files in the folder "/modules/graphic-for-rvl-codegen".
